# AMQ scripts

Collection of \*monkey userscripts for Anime Music Quiz

## `amqAutocase.user.js`

Changes your answer to lowercase so you can pretend you didn't use dropdown, or alternate casing to troll.

## `amqCoopPaste.user.js`

Defunct now with official teams mode, but playing as individual players still gives more XP/notes per right answer if everyone is on their own.
When turned on, automatically pastes your answer into the chat, and pastes other players' answers from chat into your own box if they have the script enabled.

Use at your own peril.
